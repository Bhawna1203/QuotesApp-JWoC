# QuotesApp-JWoC
Project for JWoC
The goal here is to build an app to generate quotes using my own [quotescraper API](https://github.com/w0lfw1tz/quotescraper).

## Features
- **Languages used:** Kotlin
- **Built using:** [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=en)
- **Libraries used:** Volley
- **What does the app do?:**
  - Displays random quotes generated from my own [quotescraper API](https://github.com/w0lfw1tz/quotescraper)
  - Click refresh for more random quotes (won't work until bugs are fixed both in the API and the app)
